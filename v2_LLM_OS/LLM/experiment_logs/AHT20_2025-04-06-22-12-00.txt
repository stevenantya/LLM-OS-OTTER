After the transmission is started, the first byte of I²C that is subsequently transmitted includes the 7-bit I²C device
address 0x38 and a SDA direction bit x (read R: ‘1’, write W: ‘0’). After the 8th falling edge of the SCL clock, pull
down the SDA pin (ACK bit) to indicate that the sensor data is received normally. After sending the measurement
command 0xAC, the MCU must wait until the measurement is completed.

needs CRC check, it will send an ACK reply after receiving the sixth byte, otherwise it will send a NACK reply. The

The first step is to power up the sensor with the selected VDD supply voltage (range between 2.2V and 5.5V).
After power-on, the sensor needs ≥100ms time (SCL is high at this time) to reach the idle state and it is ready to
receive commands sent by the host (MCU).
