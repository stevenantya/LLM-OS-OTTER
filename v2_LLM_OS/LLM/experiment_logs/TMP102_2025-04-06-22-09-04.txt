To communicate with the TMP102, the controller must first address target devices via a target address byte. The
target address byte consists of seven address bits, and a direction bit indicating the intent of executing a read or
write operation.

The TMP102 features an address pin to allow up to four devices to be addressed on a single bus. Table 6-4
describes the pin logic levels used to properly connect up to four devices.

Accessing a particular register on the TMP102 device is accomplished by writing the appropriate value to the
pointer register. The value for the pointer register is the first byte transferred after the target address byte with
the R/W bit low. Every write operation to the TMP102 device requires a value for the pointer register (see Figure
6-2).

1. Convert the 12-bit, left-justified binary temperature result, with the MSB = 0 to denote a positive sign, to a
decimal number.

2. Multiply the decimal number by the resolution to obtain the positive temperature.
