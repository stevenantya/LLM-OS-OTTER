START condition, the I2C write header (7-bit I2C device
address plus 0 as the write bit) and a 16-bit

the sensor responds to a read header with an ACK and
subsequently pulls down the SCL line. The SCL line is
pulled down until the measurement is complete. As soon

The status register contains information on the
operational status of the heater, the alert mode and on
the execution status of the last command and the last

register is shown in Table 17 whereas a description of
the content can be found in Table 18.

condition (S) and ends with a STOP condition (P) as
described in the I2C-bus specification. Whenever the
sensor is powered up, but not performing a
measurement or communicating, it automatically enters
idle state for energy saving. This idle state cannot be
controlled by the user. **4.2 Starting a Measurement **
