The TMP102 device responds to a two-wire general call address (000 0000) if the eighth bit is 0. The device
acknowledges the general call address and responds to commands in the second byte. If the second byte is
0000 0110, the TMP102 device internal registers are reset to power-up values. The TMP102 device does not
support the general address acquire command.
