The TMP102 device responds to a two-wire general call address (000 0000) if the eighth bit is 0. The device
acknowledges the general call address and responds to commands in the second byte. If the second byte is
0000 0110, the TMP102 device internal registers are reset to power-up values. The TMP102 device does not
support the general address acquire command.

To convert a positive digital data format to temperature:
1. Convert the 12-bit, left-justified binary temperature result, with the MSB = 0 to denote a positive sign, to a
decimal number.

2. Multiply the decimal number by the resolution to obtain the positive temperature.
