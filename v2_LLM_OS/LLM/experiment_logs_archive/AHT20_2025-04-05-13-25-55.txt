After the transmission is started, the first byte of I²C that is subsequently transmitted includes the 7-bit I²C device
address 0x38 and a SDA direction bit x (read R: ‘1’, write W: ‘0’). After the 8th falling edge of the SCL clock, pull
down the SDA pin (ACK bit) to indicate that the sensor data is received normally. After sending the measurement
command 0xAC, the MCU must wait until the measurement is completed.
