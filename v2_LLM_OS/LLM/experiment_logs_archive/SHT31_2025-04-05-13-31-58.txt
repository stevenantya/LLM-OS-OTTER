     Retrieved Chunk 2: Through the appropriate wiring of the ADDR pin the I2C
address can be selected (see Table 8 for the respective
addresses). The ADDR pin can either be connected to
logic high or logic low. The address of the sensor can be
changed dynamically during operation by switching the
level on the ADDR pin. The only constraint is that the
level has to stay constant starting from the I2C start
condition until the communication is finished. This allows

to connect more than two SHT3x-DIS onto the same bus.

     Retrieved Chunk 1: All SHT3x-DIS commands and data are mapped to a 16bit address space. Additionally, data and commands are
protected with a CRC checksum. This increases
communication reliability. The 16 bits commands to the
sensor already include a 3 bit CRC checksum. Data sent
from and received by the sensor is always succeeded by
an 8 bit CRC.
     Retrieved Chunk 2: A measurement communication sequence consists of a
START condition, the I2C write header (7-bit I2C device
address plus 0 as the write bit) and a 16-bit
measurement command. The proper reception of each
byte is indicated by the sensor. It pulls the SDA pin low
(ACK bit) after the falling edge of the 8th SCL clock to
indicate the reception. A complete measurement cycle is
depicted in Table 9.

In periodic mode different measurement commands can
be selected. The corresponding 16 bit commands are
shown in Table 10. They differ with respect to
repeatability (low, medium and high) and data
