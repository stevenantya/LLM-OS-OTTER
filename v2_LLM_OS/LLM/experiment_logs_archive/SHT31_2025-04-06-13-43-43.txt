the sensor responds to a read header with an ACK and
subsequently pulls down the SCL line. The SCL line is
pulled down until the measurement is complete. As soon

     Retrieved Chunk 1: All SHT3x-DIS commands and data are mapped to a 16bit address space. Additionally, data and commands are
protected with a CRC checksum. This increases
communication reliability. The 16 bits commands to the

from and received by the sensor is always succeeded by
an 8 bit CRC.

The status register contains information on the
operational status of the heater, the alert mode and on
the execution status of the last command and the last
write sequence. The command to read out the status
register is shown in Table 17 whereas a description of
the content can be found in Table 18.

     Retrieved Chunk 3: Each transmission sequence begins with a START
condition (S) and ends with a STOP condition (P) as
described in the I2C-bus specification. Whenever the
sensor is powered up, but not performing a
measurement or communicating, it automatically enters
idle state for energy saving. This idle state cannot be
controlled by the user. **4.2 Starting a Measurement **
