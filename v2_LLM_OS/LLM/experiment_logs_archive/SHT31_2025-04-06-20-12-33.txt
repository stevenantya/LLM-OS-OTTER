Query: What read command or register hexadecimal value triggers a sensor measurement? Which register address should be pointed to or read from to acquire data?

     Retrieved Chunk 2: A measurement communication sequence consists of a
START condition, the I2C write header (7-bit I2C device
address plus 0 as the write bit) and a 16-bit
measurement command. The proper reception of each
byte is indicated by the sensor. It pulls the SDA pin low
(ACK bit) after the falling edge of the 8th SCL clock to
indicate the reception. A complete measurement cycle is
depicted in Table 9.
     Retrieved Chunk 3: When a command with clock stretching has been issued,
the sensor responds to a read header with an ACK and
subsequently pulls down the SCL line. The SCL line is
pulled down until the measurement is complete. As soon
as the measurement is complete, the sensor releases
the SCL line and sends the measurement results. **4.5 Measurement Commands for Periodic ** **Data Acquisition Mode **

Query: What is the sensor data output length in bytes?
Retrieved chunk:
     Retrieved Chunk 1: All SHT3x-DIS commands and data are mapped to a 16bit address space. Additionally, data and commands are
protected with a CRC checksum. This increases
communication reliability. The 16 bits commands to the
sensor already include a 3 bit CRC checksum. Data sent
from and received by the sensor is always succeeded by
an 8 bit CRC.

     Retrieved Chunk 3: After the sensor has completed the measurement, the
master can read the measurement results (pair of RH&

read header. The sensor will acknowledge the reception
of the read header and send two bytes of data
