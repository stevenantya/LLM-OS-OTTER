To be able to read registers, first the register address must be sent in write mode (slave address
111011X0). Then either a stop or a repeated start condition must be generated. After this the
slave is addressed in read mode (RW = ‘1’) at address 111011X1, after which the slave sends
out data from auto-incremented register addresses until a NOACKM and stop condition occurs.
This is depicted in Figure 8, where two bytes are read from register 0xF6 and 0xF7.

The trimming parameters are programmed into the devices’ non-volatile memory (NVM) during
production and cannot be altered by the customer. Each compensation word is a 16-bit signed
or unsigned integer value stored in two’s complement. As the memory is organized into 8-bit
words, two words must always be combined in order to represent the compensation word. The
8-bit registers are named calib00…calib25 and are stored at memory addresses 0x88…0xA1.

address every register individually. This will prevent a possible mix-up of bytes belonging to
different measurements and reduce interface traffic. Data readout is done by starting a burst
read from 0xF7 to 0xFC. The data are read out in an unsigned 20-bit format both for pressure
and for temperature. It is strongly recommended to use the BMP280 API, available from Bosch
